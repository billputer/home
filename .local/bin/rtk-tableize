# This script is adapted from and meant to use the util library used
# company-wide at Rentrak. This is just a generalized utility script
# which wraps that functionality, such that it can be used outside of
# those dev servers.

# As a pre-requisite, it's necessary to have access to Rentrak's
# shared git repository and include it in `$PERL5LIB`. It is also
# necessary to satisfy the dependencies, above and beyond the core
# Perl modules, to use Tableize. Those dependencies include
# Class::MethodMaker and Time::JulianDay.
